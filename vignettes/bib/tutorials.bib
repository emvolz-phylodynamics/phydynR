    abstract = {B-splines are attractive for nonparametric modelling, but choosing the optimal number and positions of knots is a complex task. Equidistant knots can be used, but their small and discrete number al- lows only limited control over smoothness and fit. We propose to use a relatively large number of knots and a difference penalty on coefficients of adjacent B-splines. We show connections to the familiar spline penalty on the integral of the squared second derivative. A short overview of B- splines, of their construction and of penalized likelihood is presented. We discuss properties of penalized B-splines and propose various criteria for the choice of an optimal penalty parameter. Nonparametric logistic re- gression, density estimation and scatterplot smoothing are used as ex- amples. Some details of the computations are presented},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Recent reports showed the high vulnerability for HIV infection of men who have sex with men (MSM) in Africa. Here, we report the HIV-1 variants that circulate among MSM in Senegal. METHODS: HIV-1 subtype/circulating recombinant form (CRF) was determined in an 1800-base pair fragment of pol for 70 HIV-1-positive samples from MSM. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the neighbor-joining method with CLUSTALX. Similarity and bootstrap plots were then done for recombination analysis. The maximum likelihood approach was used for the identification of transmission clusters. RESULTS: Sixty-seven samples (95{\%}) were from Senegalese MSM, 90{\%} unmarried with a median age of 30 years. Fifty-five MSM had regular male partners, but 39 of 70 had also a regular female partner. The overall subtype/CRF distribution was as follows: 28 C (40{\%}), 17 CRF02{\_}AG (24.3{\%}), 13 B (18.6{\%}), 6 G (8.6{\%}), 3 CRF09{\_}cpx (4.3{\%}), and 3 (4.3{\%}) unique recombinants. In addition, 47 sequences (67.15{\%}) were segregated into 15 transmission clusters. CONCLUSIONS: These variants circulate also among the general population or female sex workers, but the proportions are significantly different. Despite the massive stigma, the majority (80{\%}) of MSM recognized having sex with women and could serve as a bridge for intermixing of HIV-1 variants between high-risk men and low-risk women.},

abstract = {HIV-1 epidemics are expanding among men who have sex with men in low- and middle-income countries. To confirm and further explore preliminary data in Senegal, we aimed to determine 3 years after a first study the HIV-1 genetic diversity in three different viral regions. From 109 samples available in 2007, 93 were sequenced in gag, 77 in env, and 60 in pol. Phylogenetic analysis showed that subtype C predominated (38-52{\%}), followed by CRF02{\_}AG (30-40{\%}), subtype B (13-17{\%}), and CRF09{\_}cpx (2.6-5{\%}). Subsubtype A3 and strains tightly linked to CRF43{\_}02G were identified in env and gag, respectively, and 12{\%} of the samples were unique recombinants. Six transmission chains involving two to seven individuals were identified. Some strains carried resistance mutations inside transmission chains. This study confirmed the existence of a dual epidemic in Senegal and emphasized the need to strengthen prevention programs to avoid strains intermixing between low-risk women and high-risk men.},

abstract = {Differential Evolution Markov Chain (DE-MC) is an adaptive MCMC algorithm, in which multiple chains are run in parallel. Standard DE-MC requires at least N=2d chains to be run in parallel, where d is the dimensionality of the posterior. This paper extends DE-MC with a snooker updater and shows by simulation and real examples that DE-MC can work for d up to 50-100 with fewer parallel chains (e.g. N=3) by exploiting information from their past by generating jumps from differences of pairs of past states. This approach extends the practical applicability of DE-MC and is shown to be about 5-26 times more efficient than the optimal Normal random walk Metropolis sampler for the 97.5{\%} point of a variable from a 25-50 dimensional Student t (3) distribution. In a nonlinear mixed effects model example the approach outperformed a block-updater geared to the specific features of the model.},

    abstract = "{Estimates of the coalescent effective population size Ne can be poorly correlated with the true population size. The relationship between Ne and the population size is sensitive to the way in which birth and death rates vary over time. The problem of inference is exacerbated when the mechanisms underlying population dynamics are complex and depend on many parameters. In instances where nonparametric estimators of Ne such as the skyline struggle to reproduce the correct demographic history, model-based estimators that can draw on prior information about population size and growth rates may be more efficient. A coalescent model is developed for a large class of populations such that the demographic history is described by a deterministic nonlinear dynamical system of arbitrary dimension. This class of demographic model differs from those typically used in population genetics. Birth and death rates are not fixed, and no assumptions are made regarding the fraction of the population sampled. Furthermore, the population may be structured in such a way that gene copies reproduce both within and across demes. For this large class of models, it is shown how to derive the rate of coalescence, as well as the likelihood of a gene genealogy with heterochronous sampling and labeled taxa, and how to simulate a coalescent tree conditional on a complex demographic history. This theoretical framework encapsulates many of the models used by ecologists and epidemiologists and should facilitate the integration of population genetics with the study of mathematical population dynamics.}",

Models are specified via an expressive and human-readable XML format and can be used as the basis for generating either single population histories or large ensembles of such histories. Importantly, phylogenetic trees or networks can be generated alongside the histories they correspond to, enabling investigations into the interplay between genealogies and population dynamics. Summary statistics such as means and variances can be recorded in place of the full ensemble, allowing for a reduction in the amount of memory used—an important consideration for models including large numbers of individual subpopulations or demes. In the case of population size histories, the resulting simulation output is written to disk in the flexible JSON format, which is easily read into numerical analysis environments such as R for visualization or further processing. Simulated phylogenetic trees can be recorded using the standard Newick or NEXUS formats, with extensions to these formats used for non-tree-like inheritance relationships.}",
