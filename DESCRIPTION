Description: This package provides functions for defining infectious disease 
    models or ecological process models in terms of 
    ODEs (ordinary differential equations) or SDEs (stochastic differential equations); 
    functions for simulating trees conditional on process models; 
    and functions for computing likelihoods of trees conditional on a process 
    model.
